## Zephyr modules

This is a library of several zephyr modules. Modules can easily be added as an
extension to your zephyr development by cloning the library in your own folder
of choice and by adding them as an `ZEPHYR_EXTRA_MODULES` on the west command
line or by defining the folder as a `ZEPHYR_EXTRA_MODULES` in your own
`.zephyrrc`.

### sfcb: a small/secure flash circular buffer, an alternative for `sfcb/nvs`.


### zepboot: a new secure bootloader for zephyr, an alternative for `mcuboot`.
